# First approach: unit tests
The probability to touch unknow code and  break it is very high, is a good practice to write all possible tests before begin and later touch the code.
So, here you can see all requirements as tests format.

As you can see, conjurer test is commented , for readability purposes i will not uncomment this test when refactor is finished.

So let's begin refactor.
